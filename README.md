# Deep Ignorance: Filtering Pretraining Data Builds Tamper-Resistant Safeguards into Open-Weight LLMs

This repository contains the filtering, training, and evaluation logic from [O'Brien et al., (2025)](). This repo can enable other researchers to filter their own datasets and evaluate models using our curated subsets of WMDP-Bio. Our LLMs and datasets can be found on our [HuggingFace collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/EleutherAI/deep-ignorance-685441040d024a0fee593d68).

## üìÑ Paper Abstract

> Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple 6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M tokens of biothreat-related text ‚Äì outperforming existing post-training baselines by over an order of magnitude ‚Äì with no observed degradation to unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI systems.

## ü§ñ Released Models

All models are 6.9B parameter models with Pythia architecture, trained on 550B tokens. They demonstrate various combinations of data filtering strategies, training phases, and post-training safeguards. All models are available on our [HuggingFace collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/EleutherAI/deep-ignorance-685441040d024a0fee593d68).

## üìÅ Repository Contents

This repository shares the core implementation components from our research:

### 1. üîç Data Filtering Pipeline (`filter.py`)
The main filtering pipeline that processes HuggingFace datasets through multiple stages:

**Filtering Stages:**
1. **Blocklist Filter**: Reviews all documents for biothreat-related keywords
   - Documents without keywords pass through unfiltered
   - Documents with 2+ keywords are escalated to the next stage

2. **ModernBERT Classifier** (optional): Semantic analysis of escalated documents
   - Fine-tuned on expert-labeled examples
   - Reduces false positives from keyword matching

3. **LM Filter** (optional): Additional language model-based validation

**Key Classes:**
- `BlocklistFilter`: Checks documents against curated biothreat keywords
- `BERTFilter`: Uses fine-tuned ModernBERT for semantic content analysis
- `LMFilter`: Optional GPT-based filtering

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic filtering with blocklist only
python filter.py --filtering_dataset=EleutherAI/dataset-name --splits=train

# Full pipeline with all filters
python filter.py --lm_filter=LM --log_judgments --use_wandb --filtering_dataset=EleutherAI/dataset-name

# With checkpoint saving for large datasets
python filter.py --save_every=0.01 --filtering_dataset=EleutherAI/dataset-name
```

### 2. üìä Dataset Processing (`download_filtered_dataset.py`)
Processes filter results to create training datasets:

**Features:**
- Manages filtered and retained documents
- Replaces filtered documents with "escalated" ones (flagged by blocklist but approved by classifier)
- Maintains dataset size and diversity
- Supports insertion of additional datasets

**Usage:**
```bash
python download_filtered_dataset.py \
    --filter-results-path=path/to/filter-results \
    --base-dataset-path=path/to/original-dataset \
    --output-dir=/output/path
```

### 3. üìà Evaluation Framework (`lm_eval_tasks/`)
- WMDP-Bio evaluation tasks for measuring biothreat proxy knowledge
- Custom safety evaluations to assess filtering effectiveness

**Evaluation Tasks:**

1. **WMDP-Bio Categorized MCQA** (`wmdp_bio_categorized_mcqa`)
   - Multiple-choice questions testing biothreat proxy knowledge
   - Split into two subsets to mitigate shortcut exploitation:
     - **Robust subset**: Questions resistant to multiple-choice heuristics
     - **Shortcut subset**: Questions that can be gamed using answer patterns
   - Categories: bioweapons, virology, pandemic pathogens, expanding access, reverse genetics, viral vectors

2. **WMDP-Bio Cloze Verified** (`wmdp_bio_cloze_verified`)
   - Fill-in-the-blank style evaluation (more challenging than MCQA)
   - Tests genuine knowledge without multiple-choice shortcuts
   - Uses perplexity-based scoring for answer selection

### 4. üöÄ Training Infrastructure
- **Dockerfiles**: For filtering (`Dockerfile.filtering`), training (`Dockerfile.training`), and evaluation (`Dockerfile.evals`) environments
- **GPT-NeoX Configs**: For pretraining and annealing phases (`pretraining/`)
- **Makefile**: For running model evaluations with lm-eval harness

### 5. üõ†Ô∏è Utility Scripts
- `count_tokens.py`: Analyzes token counts in datasets for training planning
  - Multiprocessing support for large datasets
  - Helps determine training epochs and batch sizes
- Additional analysis tools for dataset statistics
